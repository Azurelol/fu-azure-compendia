You can generate a landmass, export it as an image then import it to Foundry as a scene, allowing everyone on the table to work on the world map together.</p><p>You can use Foundry's <strong>map notes</strong> under the Journal Notes and pin them on the map for locations. This can be enhanced with the usage of the <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pin-cushion\">Pin Cushion</a> module.</p><h2>Prologue</h2><p>As suggested in the CRB, a good prologue should have the campaign hit the ground running and give an exciting welcome to your players to the world you have created together.</p><p>When preparing the prologue, it is best to target for a couple sessions worth of play and for it be a more guided experience than general play. This will give everyone time to familiarize themselves with the PCs and for the players to find out their character's voices.</p>"
