## Credits

I can't thank the developers of the unofficial Foundry VTT system, [Project FU](https://github.com/League-of-Fabulous-Developers/FoundryVTT-Fabula-Ultima) enough for their work and contribution to the very small community. I come from a software development background so I can only commend them for their regular update cadence for an open project like this. Without the system being where it is, I would not be running the game for my players or enjoying myself so much.

Since I have not contributed directly to their efforts, I feel the best I could do at the moment was to share the work I have been doing as a Game Master with the community: so that it may end up saving others even a little bit of time when they prepare for their own games.

This module has been made to be used by fellow game masters and the Fabula Ultima community at large. Since I can't draw in a straight line I have been using assets from the following royalty-free sources for icons, tokens and so on:

- [Game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/)
- [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org)
- [Aekashics](http://www.akashics.moe/)

For specific assets I will try my best to keep an `ATTRIBUTION.MD` file on the same folder as the asset to attribute the creator directly. I have taken care to use assets under the creative commons (CC) license.
